#What file contains the local DNS entries?

/etc/hosts

#I consulted man hosts and Google for this one, the man page says this line (among other things):
#The hosts file is read by mDNSResponder(8) and used to supply results for calls to getaddrinfo(3), getnameinfo(3), etc. in addition to results obtained from multicast and unicast DNS.
