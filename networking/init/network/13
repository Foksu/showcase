#Thanks to the previous question and the reverse DNS find the name of your host
#We can use host 10.12.6.11 which results in 
#11.6.12.10.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer c2r6p11.hive.fi.
#So the correct answer is:

c2r6p11.hive.fi

#Which obviously is the place where I was doing the assignment at the time
